# 3D Robotic Arm Model ‚Äì 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)

## Description

This project involves the design and modeling of a 3D robotic arm with **five degrees of freedom (DOF)**. The robotic arm is designed using CAD tools to simulate realistic movement and articulation, making it suitable for a variety of mechanical and automation-related tasks. The model features rotational joints and a gripper for object interaction.

---

## Features

- **5 DOF articulation**: Base rotation, shoulder, elbow, wrist, and gripper movement.
- **Modular joints**: Each joint is designed to mimic a human arm's flexibility.
- **3D Printable**: Parts are designed with printability in mind.
